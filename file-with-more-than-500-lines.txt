"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Don't look, just keep your eyes peeled
Thoughtless, traipsing my mind's field
Shotgun, never behind the wheel (Anymore)
Danger, monsters of smoke and mirror
Slowly, can one so lost be found?

[Chorus]
Well, I know you'll never believe
I play as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Then wake me up

[Verse 2]
Fallen leaves realize they are no friend of autumn
The view from Hell is blue sky
So ominously blue
Daydream until all the blue is gone

[Chorus]
Well, I know you'll never believe
I play as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Wake me!
